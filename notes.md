# Week 1
* Internet is collections of interconnected networks and it is not owned by nay individual or group.
* Use to exchange informations
* Local Networks
	* in home or small offices are referred as  Small Office Home Office also known as SOHO. It's enable to share files, resources yo other host (local users)
	* in bussiness, it's callled Business networks used in many ways like: selling, communicating, etc
	* provide a shared connection to the internet
* Data types
	* Volunteered
	* Observed
	* Inferred
* All the data tranfered in the internet are all in the form of binary digits. It's same as data computer processing.
* Data transfering
	* use "Physical Medium"
		* Electrical
		* Optical
		* Wireless
	* Can be converted many times during the proccess of reaching the destination, corresponding to media changes
* Bandwidth
	* is the capability of medium to carry data (send bits) theoretically  in a sec
	* Digital bandwidth measure the amount of data transfering from one place to another in the centain amount of time
	* Measurements:

bits per sec | Abbreviation
------------ | ------------
Bits |b/s
Thousands | kb/s
Millions | Mb/s
Bil | Gb/s
Tri | Tb/s

* Throughput
	* like bandwidth but it takes in considerations a number of factors so it will be less than the bandwidth. Factors are listed as below:
		* > The amount of data being sent and received over the connection
		* > The types of data being transmitted
		* > The latency created by the number of network devices encountered between source and destination
		* > Latency refers to the amount of time, including delays, for data to travel from one given point to another.
	* Notice that it **will not ignore the validity and usefulness of data** which being transmmitted and received
	* Many data which received from the networks are destined for specific 'host'
	* In internetworks or multiple-segmented network, if a segment with a lower bandwidth and others are high ones, it will slowdown at the lower bandwith segment and cause the whole slowdown in entire network -> Throughput cannot be faster than the slowest link.
* Clients and Servers
	* All objects that directly participate in the network communication (send/receive) is called as 'host'
	* Servers are host but they has pre-installed software make them able to provide infos to other hosts in network.
* Roles in the network
	* Servers and clients can run multiple softwares to act as different roles in networks
* Network Infrastucture
	* Intermediate devices (Devices that make path to connect)
	* End devices (host either source or destination)
	* Network media (method to transfer data)
	* When documenting, making a list of network infastructure comps installed make troubleshooting more easily
* End Devices
	* is uniquely identified by assigned IP
	* When host init, network used addr of des to spec how the message should be sent
